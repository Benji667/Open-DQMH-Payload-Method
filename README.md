# Open DQMH Request Message Diagram

Adds a *Right-Click Shortcut* and a *Quick Drop Ctrl-Key Shortcut* (CTRL-K by default) to DQMH Module **Request** or **Request and Wait for Reply** or **Round Trip Broadcast** methods on the block diagram allowing the developer to quickly open the Message Diagram of the Message Handling Loop within the DQMH Module Main VI.

When writing code using **DQMH Framework**, the way you communicate between actors (modules)is by way of messages. Each DQMH Module has a set of methods which collects the inputs for the message and transports it using user event, but the Public API VIs (which is often what you see on the block diagram) is not what gets executed by the actor that receives the message. The actual logic that executes when the message is received resides in the Message Handling Loop (MHL) of the DQMH Module Main VI which reads the message causes the corresponding subdiagram of the Case structure to execute. This subdiagram is called a "message diagram" because it corresponds to a message.
